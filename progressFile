// TODO:

Project 31: Given a radix base, convert to decimal
Progress:  Finished up to base 16, looking into recursive function for conversion.

Project 251: Given height, width, and seed, produce a fractal.
Progress: Split into header and class files, changed implementation of grid to a jagged array that finishes itself into a 2-dimensional array upon completion of the grid-building stage.
