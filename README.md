This is my repo for some personal projects. They're starting out small but will grow into larger projects as time progresses.

CURRENT PROJECTS:

    Radix Base Converter:

    Takes a number in a base (from 2 to 16) and converts it into decimal (base 10).

    FractalGrid(CfrostC):

    Takes arguments of width, height, and a seed (to be implemented), and produces a "fractal", similar to
    a frosted window-pane..
    Format of fractal to be decided.
