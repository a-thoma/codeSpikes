This is my repo for some personal projects. They're starting out small but will grow into larger projects as time progresses.

CURRENT PROJECTS:

    Radix Base Converter:

    Takes a number in a base (from 2 to 16) and converts it into decimal (base 10).

    FractalGrid(CfrostC):

    Takes arguments of width, height, and a seed (to be implemented), and produces a "fractal", similar to
    a frosted window-pane.
    Format of fractal to be decided.

    protoShell:

    Spike of a shell-like program I'm working on. Prompts for arguments, parses them, passes them via systemcall.

    personalTriage: TBI (To Be Implemented)

    Schedule that takes in major events entered by user, organizes them by date and level of importance (other qualifiers as well) and reports to the user what they should be focusing on, could allocate time to, etc.
