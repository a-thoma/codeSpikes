This is my repo for some personal projects. They're starting out small but will grow into larger projects as time progresses.

Radix Base Converter:

Takes a number in a base (from 2 to 16) and converts it into decimal (base 10).

CfrostC:

Takes arguments of width, height, and a seed (to be implemented), and produces a fractal.
Format of fractal to be decided.
